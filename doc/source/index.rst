===================================
Welcome to MetaSci's documentation!
===================================
MetaSci is a Python package that started as a collection of helpful functions and then ballooned.  
It is meant as a way to script over commonly used parts of other codes as well as adding additional 
functionality not included in other scientific packages.

.. note::
   **Metascience:** 1. *The science of science*, 2. *Set of thought through which knowledge is ordered*.

Due to its fuzzy definition, the term 'metascience' is often used to discuss 
`spiritual and existential matters <http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/index.php?date=020610>`_.
This connotation is used as a pun here. (MetaSci, where the magic happens!)

MetaSci currently has the following dependencies:
   #. `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
   #. `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
   #. `MatPlotLib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
   #. `PyTables <http://www.pytables.org/>`_


The source code for MetaSci may be found at the
`Launchpad project site <http://launchpad.net/metasci>`_.
Or you may simply branch from the trunk using bazaar::

    bzr branch lp:metasci
