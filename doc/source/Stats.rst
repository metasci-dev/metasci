Statistics Package
******************
Several code packages exist to perform statistics across a variety of platforms and languages.
*"Why do I need another one?!"*, you might ask.  MetaSci provides suplemental functionality
that makes life (while using other packages) easier.

The gem of this statistics package are the two- and three-dimensional contingency tables.
