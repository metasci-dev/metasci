Welcome to MetaSci
******************

MetaSci is a Python package that started as a collection of helpful 
scientifically-oriented functions and then ballooned. It is meant as a library 
of commonly used parts of other codes as well as adding additional functionality 
not included in other scientific packages.

The documentation for MetaSci may be found at:

Due to its fuzzy definition, the term 'metascience' is often used to discuss 
spiritual and existential matters. Please see 
`this awesome Toothpaste for Dinner commic http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/index.php?date=020610`_
This connotation is used as a pun here. (MetaSci, where the magic happens!)

MetaSci currently has the following dependencies:
    1. SciPy,
    2. NumPy,
    3. MatPlotLib, and
    4. PyTables.
